  # Ideally you want to just hit the api once and store that information away since you know that hitting the API takes more resources (and time frankly) then just storing the names in memory which is all you really care about until you need to actually get the information for that particular video
  #
  # Probably should do something like store the list of video names as strings as soon as you create the object and then keep that array for future use
  # This seems slightly better but I'm still not sure it's ideal
